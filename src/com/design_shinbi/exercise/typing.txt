I force my purposeless corpse along
And each time, again
Something crumbles away

When the orders given to me come to an end
Each time, again
I just become trash once more

No meaning rests within me
I don't even know who I am

A faint obsession remains
leaving me with
An unquenchable thirst
Is that the reason why my corpse is stirred up?

And, again
My organs shouldn't be able to produce anything
Still, they fasten together something inside me...

Each time there's a pause in my unclear orders
again time and time again
I stand still!!
